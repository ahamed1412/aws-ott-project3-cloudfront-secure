# 📺 AWS OTT Project 3 – Secure HLS Streaming with CloudFront + S3

This project demonstrates how to deliver an HLS (.m3u8) video stream securely using **Amazon S3** and **CloudFront** with **Origin Access Control (OAC)**.

## ✅ What I Built

- 🗂 Uploaded HLS video files (`.m3u8` and `.ts`) to a **private S3 bucket**
- 🔒 Made the bucket **non-public** and secured it using **Origin Access Control (OAC)**
- 🚀 Set up **Amazon CloudFront** to serve the video content securely
- 🎥 Used a simple HTML5 video player (`index.html`) to play the video from CloudFront

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Creating and linking **Origin Access Control (OAC)** with CloudFront
- Managing **bucket policies** securely
- Handling **Access Denied** and MIME-type issues in real time
- Real-world skills used by **OTT and Ad Tech platforms**
